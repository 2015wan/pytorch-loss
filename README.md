# pytorch-loss

My implementation of label-smooth, amsoftmax, focal-loss, dual-focal-loss, triplet-loss, giou-loss, and dice-loss(both generalized soft dice loss and batch soft dice loss). Maybe this is useful in my future work.

For those who happen to find this repo, if you see errors in my code, feel free to open an issue to correct me.
